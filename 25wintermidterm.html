          . . . Stowe is often credited with influencing the country to think differently about slavery. But what do we know about how Stowe influenced Lincoln?
        </p>
        <p>
          A decade earlier, <em>Uncle Tom’s Cabin</em> (1852) had been a publishing and propaganda phenomenon. Using stories to illustrate the human impact of slavery, Stowe’s blistering pen lit the world on fire. The statistics remain record-breaking: 10,000 copies sold in the first week; a million and a half British copies in a year. The book was so successful it was immediately dramatized for the stage, where it became a theatrical icon. Massachusetts Senator Charles Sumner, leader of the radical Republicans, said, “Had there been no <em>Uncle Tom’s Cabin</em>, there would have been no Lincoln in the White House.” . . .
        </p>
        <p>
          But pro-slavery critics charged that Stowe had made it all up and that slavery was a humane system. So Stowe wrote a nonfiction retort, <em>The Key to Uncle Tom’s Cabin</em> (1853), compiling the real-life evidence that had informed her fictional stories. . . .
