          . . . Stowe is often credited with influencing the country to think differently about slavery. But what do we know about how Stowe influenced Lincoln?
        </p>
        <p>
          A decade earlier, <em>Uncle Tom’s Cabin</em> (1852) had been a publishing and propaganda phenomenon. Using stories to illustrate the human impact of slavery, Stowe’s blistering pen lit the world on fire. The statistics remain record-breaking: 10,000 copies sold in the first week; a million and a half British copies in a year. The book was so successful it was immediately dramatized for the stage, where it became a theatrical icon. Massachusetts Senator Charles Sumner, leader of the radical Republicans, said, “Had there been no <em>Uncle Tom’s Cabin</em>, there would have been no Lincoln in the White House.” . . .
        </p>
        <p>
          But pro-slavery critics charged that Stowe had made it all up and that slavery was a humane system. So Stowe wrote a nonfiction retort, <em>The Key to Uncle Tom’s Cabin</em> (1853), compiling the real-life evidence that had informed her fictional stories. . . .

    <p class="doc-note">President Andrew Jackson is addressing the United States Congress about American Indian removal.</p>

    <div class="doc-box">
      <div class="topline">December 6, 1830</div>

      <p class="noindent"><b>President Andrew Jackson’s Second Annual Message to Congress (Excerpt, Abridged)</b></p>

      <p>
        It gives me pleasure to announce to Congress that the <b>benevolent</b> [kind or merciful] policy of the
        Government, steadily pursued for nearly thirty years, in relation to the removal of the Indians beyond
        the white settlements is approaching a happy <b>consummation</b> [ending]. Two important tribes have accepted
        the provision made for their removal at the last session of Congress, and it is believed that their example
        will induce the remaining tribes also to seek the same obvious advantages.
      </p>

      <p>
        The consequences of a speedy removal will be important to the United States, to individual States, and to
        the Indians themselves. It puts an end to all possible danger of collision between the authorities of the
        General and State Governments on account of the Indians. It will place a dense and civilized population in
        large tracts of country now occupied by a few savage hunters.
      </p>

      <p>
        By opening the whole territory between Tennessee on the north and Louisiana on the south to the settlements
        of the whites, it will strengthen the southwestern frontier. It will separate the Indians from immediate
        contact with settlements of whites; free them from the power of the States; enable them to pursue happiness
        in their own way and under their own rude institutions; and perhaps cause them gradually, under the
        protection of the Government, to cast off their savage habits, and become an interesting, civilized, and
        Christian community. These consequences make the complete execution of the plan sanctioned by Congress at
        their last session an object of much <b>solicitude</b> [care or concern].
