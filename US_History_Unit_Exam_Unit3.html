  <div class="excerpt">... The President [Thomas Jefferson] was playing for large stakes. Louisiana [Territory] stretched from the Mississippi westward to the Rocky Mountains, and from Canada's Lake of the Woods southward to the Gulf of Mexico. If annexed, these 825,000 square miles would give the new nation access to one of the world's potentially richest trading areas. The Missouri, Kansas, Arkansas and Red rivers and their tributaries could act as giant funnels carrying goods into the Mississippi and then down to New Orleans. Even in the 1790s, with access to the Mississippi only from the east, the hundreds of thousands of Americans settled along the river depended on it and on the port of New Orleans for access to both world markets and imported staples for everyday living. "The Mississippi is to them everything," Secretary of State James Madison observed privately in November 1802. "It is the Hudson, the Delaware, the Potomac, and all the navigable rivers of the Atlantic formed into one stream."</div>

“It gives me pleasure to announce to Congress that the benevolent policy of the Government... in relation to the removal of the Indians beyond the white settlements is approaching to a happy consummation... The consequences of a speedy removal will be important to the United States, to individual States, and to the Indians themselves... It puts an end to all possible danger of collision between the authorities of the General and State Governments on account of the Indians. It will place a dense and civilized population in large tracts of country now occupied by a few savage hunters... By opening the whole territory between Tennessee on the north and Louisiana on the south to the settlement of the whites it will incalculably strengthen the southwestern frontier... It will relieve the whole State of Mississippi and the western part of Alabama of Indian occupancy... It will separate the Indians from immediate contact with settlements of whites; free them from the power of the States; enable them to pursue happiness in their own way and under their own rude institutions; will retard the progress of decay... and perhaps cause them... to cast off their savage habits and become an interesting, civilized, and Christian community.”

        How does the map evidence best challenge President Jackson’s claim that removal would protect Native peoples and promote their “happiness” beyond state power?
        <div class="choices">
          <div class="choice">(1) The mapped deaths, winter routes, and river crossings show removal brought suffering and loss, not safety or well-being.</div>
          <div class="choice">(2) The mapped paths to Indian Territory show quick resettlement and steady wages, confirming protection and prosperity.</div>
          <div class="choice">(3) The mapped lines staying inside state borders show state support and new rights, matching Jackson’s stated intention.</div>
          <div class="choice">(4) The mapped return routes to the Southeast show voluntary movement back home, showing that removal was optional.</div>
